**How it works**<br/>
When the user presses the locate me button, located in the *Command Bar of the app*, the app will ask the use permission to access his/her precise location.
After getting permission, the app will show a *Progress Ring* and some text, to let the user know that something is happening in the background. 
When finished, the app will display the data from *API* along side with a map, with the user current location.<br/>
<br/>
**Note**<br/>
**The map will show with a warning, becouse I did not wanted to register my app, becouse is not a comercial aplication, that I will put on the store**
